100 days of Coding 

Day 1 - 19/04/22

Started the Udemy course "JavaScript Moderno GuÃ­a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos" (But there are really 20 projects).
Downloaded the VisualStudio Code IDE and started to learn the syntax of Javascript programming language.
Created a readme file in a new repository with my name. I will modify it later to have it as my personal CV on GitHub.

Thoughts: very motivated. Started this trend along with my friend Marwin. This course is exactly what I need to start creating my portfolio.
